## About Rentify247

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing format](routes folder > web.php ).
- [Powerful dependency injection container]([package.json, composer.json, composer.lock, package-lock.json]).
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](database folder > migration).

rentify247 is accessible, powerful, and provides tools/platform required for large, robust applications for managing homes, real estate, realtor, complex, accommodation, etc especially the rent relationship between landloads and tanants in cities and world world wide  .
